# Multi tenancy use case :

- multiple tenants (accounts) will be sharing an instance of multi-cluster hub (aka cluster). This requires proper isolation between account resources, or resources restricted only to super user access (cluster admin).

- The system is secure in such that no account user can access another accountâ€™s resources and/or configuration. When a user logs in, he/she is authenticated in the context of a specific account and all activity is performed within the context of this account.

- switching between multiple accounts needs to be supported ( targeted for future)

- Role based access control should be enabled for all resources ( cluster, Application, policies) for operational efficiceny Note: MCM provides access control at the namespace level. Role based access to namespaces is granted to teams, and Teams are defined within Accounts.

- Account rules and enforcement of account rules

# Terminology and key notes
